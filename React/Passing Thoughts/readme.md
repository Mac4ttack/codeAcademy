Passing Thoughts

What if you could post something and know it wouldn’t live forever? In this project, we’ll build a place for our passing thoughts. Once you add a short thought, it’ll disappear after just 15 seconds.

Let’s get started!

Guided instructions and starting resources provided.
Added code to solve the following:

If you try to add a new thought, it refreshes the whole page and doesn’t do anything.
If you try to delete a thought manually, it crashes!
Thoughts never disappear, defeating the whole point of the app.

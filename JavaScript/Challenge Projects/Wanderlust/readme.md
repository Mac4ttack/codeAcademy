Note: In this project, you will be using API Keys to authenticate the requests you make to the Foursquare and OpenWeather APIs. An API Key is your personal credential to access API resources and should never be shared. This means if you screenshot or send your code to someone for any reason, you should censor or remove your API Keys before doing so!

Chore Door
In this project, you will use your knowledge of JavaScript and the DOM to complete Chore Door, a single-page interactive game built with JavaScript. Before we start, let’s take a look at what your game will look like by the end of the project. Play a few rounds and see how you fare against the ChoreBot. Your goal is to open all of the doors without running into ChoreBot. If you manage to avoid ChoreBot until you open the last door, you win!
